time to close Digital Divide</h4><p class="section-full">Equity is the condition of fair and just inclusion into a society. Equity will exist when those who have been most marginalized have equal access to opportunities, power, participation and resources and all have avenues to safe, healthy, productive, and fulfilling lives. It requires restructuring deeply entrenched systems of privilege and oppression that have led to the uneven distribution of benefits and burdens over multiple generations. Society will be stronger when the promise in all of us is actualized. With inspiration from: Policy Link, King County Office of Equity and Social Justice</p><h4>Everett, Chelsea, &amp; Revere</h4><p class="section-half">Ben Forman, a Research Director at the Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth (MassINC), published “Gateway Cities at the Center of the digital divide in Massachusetts” in May of 2020. MassINC is a nonprofit think tank and news source in the state. Forman’s article provides an overview and visualization of the Census Bureau data on internet and device access for Gateway Cities in the state. The articles provides maps and key findings from this data that are filtered so that the reader can best understand the digital divide as it pertains to education for students in these cities.<br/>MassINC’s analysis of the Census data highlights the often underestimated demand for computers provided by this data set that comes from the Census. This is due to the count of households instead of a count of students by the Census. The article provides support for programs within the state that provide computers, internet access, and capacity building in the digital space. Key facts include that nearly 30,000 Gateway City households with school-age children at home do not have a laptop or desktop, more than 23,000 Gateway City households with school-age children do not have internet access, and that while Gateway Cities make up one-quarter of all households in the state, they account for more than 40 percent of households with no computers. This article is best used to support efforts towards sustainable device and internet access in the state, starting with communities of the highest need.</p></div></div></div><div id="process"><div><div class="section"><h2>Planning Process</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has upended daily life in Greater Boston and around the world.

Guided by newly <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/announcing-ookla-open-datasets/">released open data</a> and inspired by <a href="https://pcrd.purdue.edu/the-real-digital-divide-advertised-vs-actual-internet-speeds/">research</a> from other states, MAPC produced the December 2020 <a href="https://datacommon.mapc.org/calendar/2020/december">“Need for Speed”</a> data visualization that looked at speed test data across the 101 municipalities in MAPC’s region.</p><p>This work connected us to connect with communities hit hard by the pandemic and with populations most in need of recovery assistance and future resiliency. MAPC partnered with leaders in Everett, Chelsea, &amp; Revere who were working to address digital access issues, residents had raised in their communities. Residents in these communities were experiencing average internet speeds much lower than the available, advertised interest speeds along with device and literacy challenges related to the internet. The MAPC visualization of speed data depicted these communities with some of the lowest average download speeds of any municipality in the region. To explore the challenges and opportunities further, MAPC and the Cities partnered to develop this plan that is scaled to fit the capacity of municipal staff while leveraging a strong resource network of local, state, and federal resources that cross the public, private, educational, and nonprofit sectors. </p></div><div class="section-two-col-flex"><div class="section-half border-right"><h3>Community Advisory Team</h3><p>To achieve outcomes that enhance the wellbeing of the community, it’s essential that community perspective guides the work. A community advisory team served as a core working group which meet throughout the process to provide feedback, responses to proposed strategies and data analysis. This group was essential in assisting with the distribution and completion of the community needs assessment. The perspective provided by the community advisory helped inform the development of this plans vision and goals, and shaped the focus and framing of this report.

Most cities and towns within the state do not have a clear understanding of the role of local government in the area of digital access., Few Massachusetts municipalities of Chelsea, Everett, or Revere’s sizecities have adopted a clear strategy for providing fast, reliable, and affordable internet to residents and businesses.  and as sucThere is no clear template for doing so. Revere, Chelsea, and Everett h, these communities are set to become leaders within the Commonwealth by developing a plan that is scaled to fit the capacity of municipal staff while leveraging a strong resource network of local, state, and federal resources that cross the public, private, educational, and nonprofit sectors.</p><p>MAPC has structured this plan to be used by municipalities and their partner stakeholders in accomplishing the following goals:</p><h4>Advise Capital Investment</h4><p>Recent federal actions through the American Rescue Plan Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act have created an unprecedented amount of potential resources available for capital investment in broadband infrastructure. Municipalities will have discretionary resources, as well as the opportunity to apply for state and federal grants to invest in infrastructure, and this plan aims to provide a framework within which to municipalities can make sound decisions for that future investment.  </p><h4>Inform Policy Decisions​​</h4><div><p>While not involved in the direct provision of internet services, municipalities have a significant amount of regulatory power in the permitting and licensing of internet service providers and other technologies that will enable broader internet access. This includes the administration of cable franchise agreements, permitting of 5g infrastructure, and licensing right of way use for cable and fiber infrastructure. This plan aims to give municipal actors a fuller picture of how that regulatory power can improve digital access within their communities. </p><p>Further, municipalities have the ability to enact policies that will address the social and systemic barriers that inhibit the adoption or use of broadband internet. Establishing discretionary funding sources, convening critical stakeholders, and collecting community data are all within the purview of municipal activity. </p></div><h4>Identify Program Needs</h4><p>Historically, the landscape of digital access programs has been sparse, and mostly focused on building basic digital literacy skills. There is a major opportunity to build a robust ecosystem of programs available to support basic to advanced digital skills in multilingual curriculums, expanded workforce development initiatives, and community scale programs that will build capacity and expertise in this critical area.</p><p>Building on these broad goals, MAPC worked with the community advisory committees in the three communities to establish a vision that ultimately was used to establish a suite of short, medium, and long term recommendations.

It’s a complicated, interconnected [topic] that includes three main elements: a good connection to the internet, an adequate device, and knowledge of how to use it. It’s important to define “Digital Access” and provide a framework for interventions and actions aimed at achieving community outcomes. In this report we use the framework of the “three-legged stool” to represent the many facets that make up this complicated, interconnected topic.

As the slides above highlight, the internet is comprised of many technologies, each leveraged to transfer information as bits across the globe and to your screen. Who owns, manages or regulates those technologies and infrastructure is even more varied. </p><p>In our three communities, as is true Aacross the United States today,  the internet and the infrastructure that underpins it, is not treated as a public utility. Public utilities like such as water, electricity or public infrastructure like highways have a different ownership and regulation model from internet infrastructure. While water, electricity, or our highways may each have a varied different model of ownership and regulations; they all have some level of public management. The infrastructure that makes up our highway, sewer, or electric system are all publicly owned infrastructure and assets.  </p><p>While our three municipalities do manage fiber, conduit and connection center equipment, they do so for an internal public network that connects police, fire, and city staff to the internet and each other. Several municipalities across the commonwealth have extended or built publicly owned networks, under different models, that have extended beyond municipal needs or activities. A small-scale example of this is the extending of “public” networks at town halls or libraries through open public access points. This extension of the network draws on the capacity of the IT for the municipality either internal or contracted.  </p><p>Municipalities in some more rural parts of Massachusetts have taken on the role of providing publicly-owned broadband networks and resident access, often by establishing or leveraging the organizational structure and capacity of their municipal power and light plants (LINK TO LIST OF MUNI ACTIVITIES OR ILSR MAP) to become an ISP. Larger scale expansion of internet service, reliant on publicly owned infrastructure, has a number of examples in western MA To date, this model is commonly used often where no private company was willing to make the investment in wired connection of householdsto very low density areas. Municipalities have taken on the role of establishing or leveraging power and light plants (LINK TO LIST OF MUNI ACTIVITIES OR ILSR MAP) to become an ISP. Serving households or businesses with the potential to connect to other municipalities, or research institutions. In many cases the municipality have chosen to become the owner of infrastructure technology (tech referenced in slides above) as well as the provider of service ISP. This requires substantial planning (Link to and check out Cambridge and Boston, Quincy planning) as well as capacity and staffing either at a municipality, power and light utility, or private public partnership. Some government entities have also taken on the role of just owning the infrastructure and not becoming an ISP, but rather creating an open market for ISP to lease from the government their technology/infrastructure/fiber. This model is referred to as Open Access Networks and is common in other parts of the world. More example about this model can be found here: </p><p>Case studies of Government run Open Access Networks </p><p>Municipal Models Draft Literature Review </p><p>The majority of pipes/conduit, fiber and copper cables, poles and connection center equipment that run through Everett, Chelsea, and Revere are owned by private companies. For example, while the city of Chelsea may own some light poles on Broadway the majority of telephone poles across the cities are owned by the telecom company Verizon. Additionally, Comcast asserts that they only leverage infrastructure owned and managed by them in their hybrid coaxial / fiber network. (link to slides from Everett town council meeting Jan 21). Other providers we will see later in this report like Crown Castle, First Light serve as owners of infrastructure/fiber who may lease to other companies like RCN or Starry to provide residential service. In the Existing Condition: Infrastructure section we will look further into the touch points municipalities have with private companies that provide internet as a services Internet Service Providers (ISPs). </p></div></div></div><div id="existing-conditions"><div><div class="section" id="tabs"><h2>Existing Conditions</h2><div class="react-tabs" data-rttabs="true"><ul class="react-tabs__tab-list" role="tablist"><li class="react-tabs__tab react-tabs__tab--selected" role="tab" id="react-tabs-12" aria-selected="true" aria-disabled="false" aria-controls="react-tabs-13" tabindex="0" data-rttab="true"><h4>Connection &amp; Access</h4></li><li class="react-tabs__tab" role="tab" id="react-tabs-14" aria-selected="false" aria-disabled="false" aria-controls="react-tabs-15" data-rttab="true"><h4>Digital Literacy</h4></li><li class="react-tabs__tab" role="tab" id="react-tabs-16" aria-selected="false" aria-disabled="false" aria-controls="react-tabs-17" data-rttab="true"><h4>Service &amp; Affordability</h4></li><li class="react-tabs__tab" role="tab" id="react-tabs-18" aria-selected="false" aria-disabled="false" aria-controls="react-tabs-19" data-rttab="true"><h4>Infrastructure</h4></li></ul><div class="react-tabs__tab-panel react-tabs__tab-panel--selected" role="tabpanel" id="react-tabs-13" aria-labelledby="react-tabs-12"><div><div class="section"><p>Currently, access to the internet is not managed as a public utility with , guaranteeingd access to for all residents. Without that guarantee, access to the internet is heavily influenced by the economic and societal makeup of a community. Having a low household income, living with a high number of individuals per household, not understanding the language for which guidance or marketing materials are produced, being older and non-digital native can all be compounding barriers to internet access.</p><p>Using the accompanying chart, we can explore a variety of census data about our the communities (Chelsea, Everett, and Revere). We can see that tThe cities of Chelsea, Everett, and Revere are some of the most diverse communities in Massachusetts, w. With a higher-than-average number of languages spoken in the communities than in most MA communities as well a high rate of foreign-born population.</p><p>These communities also have many residents with limited income. The median household income in (Chelsea, Everett, and Revere) is $61,600 [calculated # if aggregated].  In fact, more than 20% of households in the three cities are categorized as “extremely low income” meaning they make less than 30% of HUD’s Median Area Family Income. </p><p>Further, we know that mmany households in the three communities are larger, withhave more than four people. More individuals with more devices are competing to pull and push data within the bounds of an internet service providers plan. Multiple users of the internet on lower service plans can caused significant challenges for students and parents who need to work or attend school remotely. </p><p>Bar chart with Chelsea, Everett, Revere, MA, MAPC Region:</p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/bar-chart-placeholder-ae0416edd6d7361b8de4c11c67a08fd6.png"/></div><div class="section"><h4>Connected to the Internet</h4><p>The American Community Survey also captures data on internet connection. The current survey asks… [if you have internet, what kind of plan—summarize how the question is asked.] As shown in the data viz below, almost 16% of Everett households, and more than 18% of Revere and Chelsea households, have no internet connection at home.</p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/without-internet-c957b5f95ceef2ac82f8e3a1dc671e52.png"/><p>The connection to the internet is not distributed equally. While the number of households with a fiber / broadband level speed lags behinds the state and region, the lack of connection is even more pronounced to for those households living below 200% of below the poverty threshold.</p><p>Access to the internet is also a racial equity issue. Analysis of the digital divide shows that Black and Latinx residents are also disproportionately represented in “Unconnected Communities,” defined as….   We know nationally disconnect households are disproportionately impacting communities of color.</p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/race-e45f67f4953ab4e2bfbd6d30d2ac1ed4.png"/><p>The Census data above highlights that these three communities have some of the highest  populations of Black and Latinx populations in region and state.</p><p>Another source of data is the required federal self-reporting done by internet service providers to help understand connection. The FCC requires that twice a year internet service providers self-report service coverage online through Form 477. The data from these filings gives one picture of internet connection across the country. While the data is open and available, it can exaggerate the available service area given data and reporting limitations.</p><p>The data is reported at a census block level. A census block is a federal unit of geography that can contain clusters of many buildings. Some census blocks in Everett, Chelsea, and Revere contain more than 50 residential buildings. If one address in a census block is serviced by an ISP the whole census block is reported as a serviced area. Additionally, anecdotal evidence has shown that ISP’s may refuse service to households even within their service area, oftentimes due to the cost of connecting that home does not provide the return on investment required to serve that address. </p><p>Complicating the question of coverage, Form 477 is self-reported by providers and does not include levels of service offered. Providers are only asked to report the highest levels of speed (mbps download and upload) serviced provided infor each census block. What is not reported is the different service level available at what cost. While the FCC is working to implement “Broadband Nutrition Labels”, today clearcurrent comparisons ofinformation about viability speed and cost between providers is limited to the form 477 data. Only the ISPs know the dDetails of what addresses are served, not served, or where the infrastructure is; this level of detail  known only by the individual ISPs and not reported to the FCC, nor regularly reported through other state or local requirements. (SEE RECOMMENDATION: XX Data Reporting)</p><p>Form 477 data does can in part start to illustrate who are the major available providers, and what technology is prevalent in the a given area. The table below lists providers from the FCC data. Comcast, RCN, Starry, and NetBlazr each service some portion of Everett, Chelsea and/or Revere. There are a limited number of providers in the area who can provide 100/10 speeds. Those that can provide those speeds, use a mix of fiber, fixed wireless, and cable technologies.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/FCC_DA_Munis/TechnologyTableDashboard?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="828"></iframe><p>The Form 477 data is mapped below, where the color indicates the number of ISPs that report serving that census block. Many census blocks have 2 provider options, and the darkest colored areas have all 4 of these residential provider options available in the census block. It’s worth mentioning again that a provider reporting via Form 477 that it serves a given census block is no guarantee that all residents have or could even subscribe to that provider.  While business may have additional ISP options residents across these three communities don’t have the same level of choice nor competition.</p><iframe src="https://mapc.github.io/fcc-map/" width="100%" height="600"></iframe><p>Looking closer at the technologies used in the map below, there are less fewer than 20 census blocks where the service connection allows a direct connection to the internet via fiber optic lines from any one of the providers. that the 4 area residential providers report having fiber connections within them. This doesn’t mean that there’s no fiber: This map and data does not mean these residential providers (Comcast, RCN, Starry, netBlazr)b do not utilize fiber in these communities. What it does show is that both Comcast and RCN networks have hybrid fiber/coaxial networks in these communities, but nearly every connection will rely in part on still report relying on some coaxial / cable technology (listed as DOCSIS 3.0 /3.1 systems) between the home and the internet across their full area of services. While these ISP have hybrid fiber/coaxial networks, no blocks are reported as being served solely by fiber, highlighting that aA full fiber to the home network, replacing the slower coaxial lines, would require significant investment to achieve given the current state.</p></div><div class="section"><h4>Device Ownership</h4><p>The state of device ownership in Everett, prior to the pandemic can be glimpsed assessed through Census ACS  data. The accompanying table/chart highlights the Of more than 16,00021 households in Everett, almost 20%  of them as of 2019, 3,178 households one in five (just under [20%]) did not have a desktop or laptop to serve as a computing  device. This lags the statewide average of 14% (or the MAPC region calculate?)</p><p>Those households without a desktop or laptop (45%, or 1,433 households) did indicate they have a mobile smart device (smartphone or tablet). However, as we have seen expressed acutely in recent years, full participation in society often requires a computing device beyond a phone to apply for jobs or work remotely, complete forms or applications, attend virtual classes, teleconference with doctors, virtually connect with family, shop safely and securely online. While mobile devices may someday be capable of connecting residents to a full set of services, we can see from these resident stories described below below show that without a computing device beyond a phone, residents can be disconnected from the broaorder economy and society.  </p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/smartphone-27af7ab381654d6a62a1729891cf7d11.png"/></div></div><a class="anchor__wrapper" href="/digital-equity-report/report/#tabs"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="circle-up" class="svg-inline--fa fa-circle-up anchor__icon" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M256 0C114.6 0 0 114.6 0 256s114.6 256 256 256c141.4 0 256-114.6 256-256S397.4 0 256 0zM382.8 246.1C380.3 252.1 374.5 256 368 256h-64v96c0 17.67-14.33 32-32 32h-32c-17.67 0-32-14.33-32-32V256h-64C137.5 256 131.7 252.1 129.2 246.1C126.7 240.1 128.1 233.3 132.7 228.7l112-112c6.248-6.248 16.38-6.248 22.62 0l112 112C383.9 233.3 385.3 240.1 382.8 246.1z"></path></svg><span class="anchor__helper-text">Return to Selection</span></a></div><div class="react-tabs__tab-panel" role="tabpanel" id="react-tabs-15" aria-labelledby="react-tabs-14"></div><div class="react-tabs__tab-panel" role="tabpanel" id="react-tabs-17" aria-labelledby="react-tabs-16"></div><div class="react-tabs__tab-panel" role="tabpanel" id="react-tabs-19" aria-labelledby="react-tabs-18"></div></div></div></div></div><div id="assessment"><div><div class="section"><h2>Community Needs Assessment</h2><p>Expanding on the existing conditions analysis, MAPC worked to further understand the specific experiences of residents in the three communities accessing and using the internet.

In Chelsea, where Comcast is the only cable ISP, 80% of respondents used Comcast. In Revere and Everett that number was between 63 and 67%, with an average of 20% of respondents using RCN as an available competitor. In all three communities, about 6% of respondents were still using Verizon DSL services. About 8% of respondents in all communities rely on T Mobile or MetroPCS Hotspot mobile subscriptions. Chelsea had the highest number of T-Mobile or MetroPCS wireless service subscriptions as the primary form of internet service. Wireless ISP providers like Starry and NetBlazer are available in all three communities, but have had limited market penetration, with only 1% of survey respondents using that service. In Revere and Everett where RCN is an available competitor to Comcast, those communities had about 20% of users subscribing to an alternative to Comcast.
