time to close Digital Divide</h4><p class="section-full">Equity is the condition of fair and just inclusion into a society. Equity will exist when those who have been most marginalized have equal access to opportunities, power, participation and resources and all have avenues to safe, healthy, productive, and fulfilling lives. It requires restructuring deeply entrenched systems of privilege and oppression that have led to the uneven distribution of benefits and burdens over multiple generations. Society will be stronger when the promise in all of us is actualized. With inspiration from: Policy Link, King County Office of Equity and Social Justice</p><h4>Everett, Chelsea, &amp; Revere</h4><p class="section-half">Ben Forman, a Research Director at the Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth (MassINC), published “Gateway Cities at the Center of the digital divide in Massachusetts” in May of 2020. MassINC is a nonprofit think tank and news source in the state. Forman’s article provides an overview and visualization of the Census Bureau data on internet and device access for Gateway Cities in the state. The articles provides maps and key findings from this data that are filtered so that the reader can best understand the digital divide as it pertains to education for students in these cities.<br/>MassINC’s analysis of the Census data highlights the often underestimated demand for computers provided by this data set that comes from the Census. This is due to the count of households instead of a count of students by the Census. The article provides support for programs within the state that provide computers, internet access, and capacity building in the digital space. Key facts include that nearly 30,000 Gateway City households with school-age children at home do not have a laptop or desktop, more than 23,000 Gateway City households with school-age children do not have internet access, and that while Gateway Cities make up one-quarter of all households in the state, they account for more than 40 percent of households with no computers. This article is best used to support efforts towards sustainable device and internet access in the state, starting with communities of the highest need.</p></div></div></div><div id="process"><div><div class="section"><h2>Planning Process</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has upended daily life in Greater Boston and around the world.

Guided by newly <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/announcing-ookla-open-datasets/">released open data</a> and inspired by <a href="https://pcrd.purdue.edu/the-real-digital-divide-advertised-vs-actual-internet-speeds/">research</a> from other states, MAPC produced the December 2020 <a href="https://datacommon.mapc.org/calendar/2020/december">“Need for Speed”</a> data visualization that looked at speed test data across the 101 municipalities in MAPC’s region.</p><p>This work connected us to connect with communities hit hard by the pandemic and with populations most in need of recovery assistance and future resiliency. MAPC partnered with leaders in Everett, Chelsea, &amp; Revere who were working to address digital access issues, residents had raised in their communities. Residents in these communities were experiencing average internet speeds much lower than the available, advertised interest speeds along with device and literacy challenges related to the internet. The MAPC visualization of speed data depicted these communities with some of the lowest average download speeds of any municipality in the region. To explore the challenges and opportunities further, MAPC and the Cities partnered to develop this plan that is scaled to fit the capacity of municipal staff while leveraging a strong resource network of local, state, and federal resources that cross the public, private, educational, and nonprofit sectors. </p></div><div class="section-two-col-flex"><div class="section-half border-right"><h3>Community Advisory Team</h3><p>To achieve outcomes that enhance the wellbeing of the community, it’s essential that community perspective guides the work. A community advisory team served as a core working group which meet throughout the process to provide feedback, responses to proposed strategies and data analysis. This group was essential in assisting with the distribution and completion of the community needs assessment. The perspective provided by the community advisory helped inform the development of this plans vision and goals, and shaped the focus and framing of this report.

Most cities and towns within the state do not have a clear understanding of the role of local government in the area of digital access., Few Massachusetts municipalities of Chelsea, Everett, or Revere’s sizecities have adopted a clear strategy for providing fast, reliable, and affordable internet to residents and businesses.  and as sucThere is no clear template for doing so. Revere, Chelsea, and Everett h, these communities are set to become leaders within the Commonwealth by developing a plan that is scaled to fit the capacity of municipal staff while leveraging a strong resource network of local, state, and federal resources that cross the public, private, educational, and nonprofit sectors.</p><p>MAPC has structured this plan to be used by municipalities and their partner stakeholders in accomplishing the following goals:</p><h4>Advise Capital Investment</h4><p>Recent federal actions through the American Rescue Plan Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act have created an unprecedented amount of potential resources available for capital investment in broadband infrastructure. Municipalities will have discretionary resources, as well as the opportunity to apply for state and federal grants to invest in infrastructure, and this plan aims to provide a framework within which to municipalities can make sound decisions for that future investment.  </p><h4>Inform Policy Decisions​​</h4><div><p>While not involved in the direct provision of internet services, municipalities have a significant amount of regulatory power in the permitting and licensing of internet service providers and other technologies that will enable broader internet access. This includes the administration of cable franchise agreements, permitting of 5g infrastructure, and licensing right of way use for cable and fiber infrastructure. This plan aims to give municipal actors a fuller picture of how that regulatory power can improve digital access within their communities. </p><p>Further, municipalities have the ability to enact policies that will address the social and systemic barriers that inhibit the adoption or use of broadband internet. Establishing discretionary funding sources, convening critical stakeholders, and collecting community data are all within the purview of municipal activity. </p></div><h4>Identify Program Needs</h4><p>Historically, the landscape of digital access programs has been sparse, and mostly focused on building basic digital literacy skills. There is a major opportunity to build a robust ecosystem of programs available to support basic to advanced digital skills in multilingual curriculums, expanded workforce development initiatives, and community scale programs that will build capacity and expertise in this critical area.</p><p>Building on these broad goals, MAPC worked with the community advisory committees in the three communities to establish a vision that ultimately was used to establish a suite of short, medium, and long term recommendations.

It’s a complicated, interconnected [topic] that includes three main elements: a good connection to the internet, an adequate device, and knowledge of how to use it. It’s important to define “Digital Access” and provide a framework for interventions and actions aimed at achieving community outcomes. In this report we use the framework of the “three-legged stool” to represent the many facets that make up this complicated, interconnected topic.

As the slides above highlight, the internet is comprised of many technologies, each leveraged to transfer information as bits across the globe and to your screen. Who owns, manages or regulates those technologies and infrastructure is even more varied. </p><p>In our three communities, as is true Aacross the United States today,  the internet and the infrastructure that underpins it, is not treated as a public utility. Public utilities like such as water, electricity or public infrastructure like highways have a different ownership and regulation model from internet infrastructure. While water, electricity, or our highways may each have a varied different model of ownership and regulations; they all have some level of public management. The infrastructure that makes up our highway, sewer, or electric system are all publicly owned infrastructure and assets.  </p><p>While our three municipalities do manage fiber, conduit and connection center equipment, they do so for an internal public network that connects police, fire, and city staff to the internet and each other. Several municipalities across the commonwealth have extended or built publicly owned networks, under different models, that have extended beyond municipal needs or activities. A small-scale example of this is the extending of “public” networks at town halls or libraries through open public access points. This extension of the network draws on the capacity of the IT for the municipality either internal or contracted.  </p><p>Municipalities in some more rural parts of Massachusetts have taken on the role of providing publicly-owned broadband networks and resident access, often by establishing or leveraging the organizational structure and capacity of their municipal power and light plants (LINK TO LIST OF MUNI ACTIVITIES OR ILSR MAP) to become an ISP. Larger scale expansion of internet service, reliant on publicly owned infrastructure, has a number of examples in western MA To date, this model is commonly used often where no private company was willing to make the investment in wired connection of householdsto very low density areas. Municipalities have taken on the role of establishing or leveraging power and light plants (LINK TO LIST OF MUNI ACTIVITIES OR ILSR MAP) to become an ISP. Serving households or businesses with the potential to connect to other municipalities, or research institutions. In many cases the municipality have chosen to become the owner of infrastructure technology (tech referenced in slides above) as well as the provider of service ISP. This requires substantial planning (Link to and check out Cambridge and Boston, Quincy planning) as well as capacity and staffing either at a municipality, power and light utility, or private public partnership. Some government entities have also taken on the role of just owning the infrastructure and not becoming an ISP, but rather creating an open market for ISP to lease from the government their technology/infrastructure/fiber. This model is referred to as Open Access Networks and is common in other parts of the world. More example about this model can be found here: </p><p>Case studies of Government run Open Access Networks </p><p>Municipal Models Draft Literature Review </p><p>The majority of pipes/conduit, fiber and copper cables, poles and connection center equipment that run through Everett, Chelsea, and Revere are owned by private companies. For example, while the city of Chelsea may own some light poles on Broadway the majority of telephone poles across the cities are owned by the telecom company Verizon. Additionally, Comcast asserts that they only leverage infrastructure owned and managed by them in their hybrid coaxial / fiber network. (link to slides from Everett town council meeting Jan 21). Other providers we will see later in this report like Crown Castle, First Light serve as owners of infrastructure/fiber who may lease to other companies like RCN or Starry to provide residential service. In the Existing Condition: Infrastructure section we will look further into the touch points municipalities have with private companies that provide internet as a services Internet Service Providers (ISPs). </p></div></div></div><div id="existing-conditions"><div><div class="section"><h2>Existing Conditions</h2><div><div class="section"><h3>Connection and Access</h3><h4>Communities at a Glance</h4><p>Currently, access to the internet is not managed as a public utility with , guaranteeingd access to for all residents. Without that guarantee, access to the internet is heavily influenced by the economic and societal makeup of a community. Having a low household income, living with a high number of individuals per household, not understanding the language for which guidance or marketing materials are produced, being older and non-digital native can all be compounding barriers to internet access.</p><p>Using the accompanying chart, we can explore a variety of census data about our the communities (Chelsea, Everett, and Revere). We can see that tThe cities of Chelsea, Everett, and Revere are some of the most diverse communities in Massachusetts, w. With a higher-than-average number of languages spoken in the communities than in most MA communities as well a high rate of foreign-born population.</p><p>These communities also have many residents with limited income. The median household income in (Chelsea, Everett, and Revere) is $61,600 [calculated # if aggregated].  In fact, more than 20% of households in the three cities are categorized as “extremely low income” meaning they make less than 30% of HUD’s Median Area Family Income. </p><p>Further, we know that mmany households in the three communities are larger, withhave more than four people. More individuals with more devices are competing to pull and push data within the bounds of an internet service providers plan. Multiple users of the internet on lower service plans can caused significant challenges for students and parents who need to work or attend school remotely. </p><p>Bar chart with Chelsea, Everett, Revere, MA, MAPC Region:</p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/bar-chart-placeholder-ae0416edd6d7361b8de4c11c67a08fd6.png"/></div><div class="section"><h4>Connected to the Internet</h4><p>The American Community Survey also captures data on internet connection. The current survey asks… [if you have internet, what kind of plan—summarize how the question is asked.] As shown in the data viz below, almost 16% of Everett households, and more than 18% of Revere and Chelsea households, have no internet connection at home.</p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/without-internet-c957b5f95ceef2ac82f8e3a1dc671e52.png"/><p>The connection to the internet is not distributed equally. While the number of households with a fiber / broadband level speed lags behinds the state and region, the lack of connection is even more pronounced to for those households living below 200% of below the poverty threshold.</p><p>Access to the internet is also a racial equity issue. Analysis of the digital divide shows that Black and Latinx residents are also disproportionately represented in “Unconnected Communities,” defined as….   We know nationally disconnect households are disproportionately impacting communities of color.</p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/race-e45f67f4953ab4e2bfbd6d30d2ac1ed4.png"/><p>The Census data above highlights that these three communities have some of the highest  populations of Black and Latinx populations in region and state.</p><p>Another source of data is the required federal self-reporting done by internet service providers to help understand connection. The FCC requires that twice a year internet service providers self-report service coverage online through Form 477. The data from these filings gives one picture of internet connection across the country. While the data is open and available, it can exaggerate the available service area given data and reporting limitations.</p><p>The data is reported at a census block level. A census block is a federal unit of geography that can contain clusters of many buildings. Some census blocks in Everett, Chelsea, and Revere contain more than 50 residential buildings. If one address in a census block is serviced by an ISP the whole census block is reported as a serviced area. Additionally, anecdotal evidence has shown that ISP’s may refuse service to households even within their service area, oftentimes due to the cost of connecting that home does not provide the return on investment required to serve that address. </p><p>Complicating the question of coverage, Form 477 is self-reported by providers and does not include levels of service offered. Providers are only asked to report the highest levels of speed (mbps download and upload) serviced provided infor each census block. What is not reported is the different service level available at what cost. While the FCC is working to implement “Broadband Nutrition Labels”, today clearcurrent comparisons ofinformation about viability speed and cost between providers is limited to the form 477 data. Only the ISPs know the dDetails of what addresses are served, not served, or where the infrastructure is; this level of detail  known only by the individual ISPs and not reported to the FCC, nor regularly reported through other state or local requirements. (SEE RECOMMENDATION: XX Data Reporting)</p><p>Form 477 data does can in part start to illustrate who are the major available providers, and what technology is prevalent in the a given area. The table below lists providers from the FCC data. Comcast, RCN, Starry, and NetBlazr each service some portion of Everett, Chelsea and/or Revere. There are a limited number of providers in the area who can provide 100/10 speeds. Those that can provide those speeds, use a mix of fiber, fixed wireless, and cable technologies.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/FCC_DA_Munis/TechnologyTableDashboard?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="828"></iframe><p>The Form 477 data is mapped below, where the color indicates the number of ISPs that report serving that census block. Many census blocks have 2 provider options, and the darkest colored areas have all 4 of these residential provider options available in the census block. It’s worth mentioning again that a provider reporting via Form 477 that it serves a given census block is no guarantee that all residents have or could even subscribe to that provider.  While business may have additional ISP options residents across these three communities don’t have the same level of choice nor competition.</p><iframe src="https://mapc.github.io/fcc-map/" width="100%" height="600"></iframe><p>Looking closer at the technologies used in the map below, there are less fewer than 20 census blocks where the service connection allows a direct connection to the internet via fiber optic lines from any one of the providers. that the 4 area residential providers report having fiber connections within them. This doesn’t mean that there’s no fiber: This map and data does not mean these residential providers (Comcast, RCN, Starry, netBlazr)b do not utilize fiber in these communities. What it does show is that both Comcast and RCN networks have hybrid fiber/coaxial networks in these communities, but nearly every connection will rely in part on still report relying on some coaxial / cable technology (listed as DOCSIS 3.0 /3.1 systems) between the home and the internet across their full area of services. While these ISP have hybrid fiber/coaxial networks, no blocks are reported as being served solely by fiber, highlighting that aA full fiber to the home network, replacing the slower coaxial lines, would require significant investment to achieve given the current state.</p></div><div class="section"><h4>Device Ownership</h4><p>The state of device ownership in Everett, prior to the pandemic can be glimpsed assessed through Census ACS  data. The accompanying table/chart highlights the Of more than 16,00021 households in Everett, almost 20%  of them as of 2019, 3,178 households one in five (just under [20%]) did not have a desktop or laptop to serve as a computing  device. This lags the statewide average of 14% (or the MAPC region calculate?)</p><p>Those households without a desktop or laptop (45%, or 1,433 households) did indicate they have a mobile smart device (smartphone or tablet). However, as we have seen expressed acutely in recent years, full participation in society often requires a computing device beyond a phone to apply for jobs or work remotely, complete forms or applications, attend virtual classes, teleconference with doctors, virtually connect with family, shop safely and securely online. While mobile devices may someday be capable of connecting residents to a full set of services, we can see from these resident stories described below below show that without a computing device beyond a phone, residents can be disconnected from the broaorder economy and society.  </p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/smartphone-27af7ab381654d6a62a1729891cf7d11.png"/></div></div><div><div class="section"><h3>Digital Literacy</h3></div><div class="section-two-col-flex"><div class="section-half"><p>As essential as it is to have the device or connection to the internet, it’s as essential to have the skills and ability to be successful in navigating that digital landscape.  The NDIA defines digital literacy as “the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills”. The “digital” in digital literacy skills casts a wide net and encompasses many skills a person or user may need to leverage devices and connection. Translated to daily life, dDigital skills are required to operate a device, obtain, and email address, apply for a job, communicate with a doctor, and connect with family members. Assessments such as the NorthStar Digital Literacy assessment, purchased (by City of Revere?) can provide a way of assessing levels of digital literacy.</p><p>It’s important to note that digital literacy can be compounded by the lack of literacy skills. This is acutely true when information, guidance, or support aimed at growing skills is not presented in a language that is shared and understood. Language and culturally appropriate guidance can support the growth of all skills including digital skills.</p><p>A recent 2021 Pew study found that 30% of adults are not “tech ready,” meaning they need support to set up or navigate a new computer, smartphone or other electronic device or have little to no confidence to use those devices to do the things they need to do online. The digital literacy issue is even greater with older adults.</p></div><div class="section-half"><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/pew-5d02de335ca67e63ce5611339b1c51f0.png"/></div></div><div class="section-two-col-flex"><div class="section-half"><p>MAPC’s survey of Chelsea, Everett and Revere residents showed approximately 18% of respondents did not feel confident in their ability to use a Chromebook, tablet or computer. </p><p>There are many ways for a person to develop or gain skills that can help them to be more productive and secure while accessing services and information across the web. <a href="https://www.digitalinclusion.org/digital-navigator-model/">The National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA)</a> has pioneered many efforts to bridge the digital divide, most recently through the Digital Navigator program, a train the trainer model that enables staff at community organizations to support computer users using common applications such as email, Google search, and other productivity tools; sign up for discounted Internet service; and provide light IT support. Digital Navigators have been placed in libraries, schools, and community-based organizations. The MetroNorth Work Force Board, through their YouthWorks programming and with support from Comcast, is currently organizing Digital Navigator programs in Everett, Revere, and Malden municipal offices.</p></div><div class="section-half"><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/literacy-survey-2291a6da1a412336ce87e55f85336b2f.png"/></div></div></div><div><div class="section"><h3>Service &amp; Affordability</h3><h4>Why are households offline?</h4><p>Looking nationally at this question, the national nonprofit Education Superhighway has <a href="https://www.educationsuperhighway.org/no-home-left-offline/">released a report</a> that categorizes the reasons why US households are offline. They identified 28.2 million unconnected households across the US. While a portion 11% of the population is choosing not to connect and another 25% do not have the available infrastructure to connect, the majority of the unconnected households cite affordability as the reason why they are not connected 64%.</p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/edu-superhighway-87d196f91bec1fea3a31ae45a8b2b28b.png"/><p>This Broadband Affordability Gap is a major component as to why households in Everett, Chelsea, and Revere are not connected. A large majority of those residents are offline because they can’t afford to connect to an available Internet connection. While advances in technology and expansion of networks over the past decades has seen the offline population of US adults decline from 48% in 2000 to 7% in 2021 (PEW), there are still 18.1 million US households offline because of the affordability gap .  Across Massachusetts there are approximately 380,233 unconnected households, and approximately XXX thousands of those households are in our communities of Everett, Chelsea, and Revere. As we have allowed market forces to lead the expansion of networks and connection of households, it has left those that can least afford it left unconnected. </p><p>The challenge of affordability is something that affects urban and rural areas. As our Community Needs Assessment Survey further illustrates this need (LINK), it’s clear that the cost of internet services is dramatically impacting the affecting the lives of residents in our communities.</p><p>While states like <a href="https://www.utopiafiber.com/">Utah</a> have established private-public entities to increase competition and drive prices to address the broadband affordability gap, we have not done the same here at the state level. Massachusetts does have municipalities working on their own to establish open public-private models to drive competition (Quincy, Fairhaven) and others that have established a public option for broadband services (Open Cape, Braintree, Leverett, etc.). Given the unprecedented federal investment available to communities, now is the time to make a generational investment that fundamentally addresses the market landscape of broadband. We know from research that the cost of broadband services only goes down when there are more than 3 providers competing against each other (REF Needed). Systemic and intuitional changes are needed to connect all households.  (See Recommendation XX) </p></div><div class="section"><h4>How much does broadband service cost in our communities? </h4><p>How much does broadband service cost in our communities? </p><p>As we saw in the self-reported FCC data, Comcast, RCN, Verizon, netBlazer, and Starry are the main providers that have any service in the area. While these plans might not be available at every address in the three municipalities, we list here the services packages that can be found at sample addresses from the communities. These are residential service advertised prices. Commercial providers like Crown Castle, FirstLight, Windstream, or Comcast Business are not included in this chart.</p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/tableau-placeholder-88c2344ea614d013e40cfaecaf05e715.png"/></div><div class="section"><h4>Have subsidies closed the broadband affordability gap?</h4><p>Our collective attempts to address the broadband affordability gap to this point have not been effective at removing the cost barrier for many low-income families to afford the service.  The consumer programs in particular have seen low participation due to lack of promotion, difficulty in application rules, and lack of trust in government programs.</p><p>Federal rules and subsidy opportunities have <a href="https://www.digitalinclusion.org/free-low-cost-internet-plans/">motivated most major providers</a> to offer discounted plans.  Comcast’s Internet Essentials model is the most widely known in our area and used by XX% of survey participants. To qualify, the ISP requires applicants must have no debt with the company, have not been a Comcast Internet customer for 90 days prior, and be a participant in one of <a href="https://www.internetessentials.com/get-help#application&amp;Documentsneeded">several social assistance programs</a> such as SNAP, free or reduced lunch, Pell grants and others. Stakeholders and survey respondents report difficulty with the application process independent of the internet provider, upselling when signing up, and other concerns. Adding to the challenge, income-eligible programs, be it Comcast, Verizon, or others are not prominently listed alongside other plans on sites like BroadbandNow, HighspeedInternet, AllConnect, Broadband Research which appear at the top Google search result for plans. Newer internet service providers, Starry and netBlazr have implemented a model of qualifying affordable housing properties through the sponsor organization rather than individuals who live there for a discounted service, but those companies have much smaller service areas. </p><p>Modeled after the Lifeline phone program, the federal government also began offering a subsidy directly to consumers in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021. The Emergency Broadband Benefit offered qualifying households a $50 subsidy for broadband service and a $100 rebate for device purchase. Rebranded as the Affordable Connectivity Program in January 2022 and taking effect March 1 of the same year, Congress reduced the benefit to $30, but extended the length of the once temporary program.</p><p>Subscribers may take advantage of the private and public subsidies, significantly reducing the cost of broadband access. As part of their digital literacy programs, Tech Goes Home and Digital Navigators aid prospective households to sign up for the programs, but meanwhile are using MIFI devices for their programs for the ease of setup and use.  Despite these and other efforts, approximately XX percent of eligible households are taking advantage of these programs.  </p></div><div class="section"><h4>For those that are connected, what are they experiencing?</h4><p>In addition to 15-19% of households we saw that were not connected to the internet, we can see from speed test that that an additional XX40% may not consistently be experiencing broadband level of speed. Those that have purchased an internet service plan that is classified as broadband level (25/3) may not be experiencing broadband levels of speed. (See Recommendation on change to 100/100).</p><p>If we look at speed test data form from Microsoft and speed test sites (MLab / Ookla) they suggest the problem is significantly larger because a sizeable share of households with internet service do not operate at broadband speeds. </p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/mlab-8e494d3ea6e5dfff65c39f22ceb73eb7.png"/></div></div><div><div class="section"><h3>Infrastructure</h3><p>Alongside the public infrastructure of sewer, water, and roads in Everett, Chelsea, and Revere private companies have run many miles of cables underneath city streets and poles, providing a connection to the internet. Unlike rural areas in Massachusetts and across the United States, there exists relatively more wiring in these urban areas to connect residents and businesses to the internet. This can be attributed in large part to the market forces driving this private installation of wiring. The desire to connect large amounts of customers as efficiently as possible. Large dense urban areas provide more potential customers per mile of investment.</p><p>However, as we have seen in the access and service &amp; affordability sections of this report, having wiring on your street does not mean you are able to connect of leverage that infrastructure. The type of wiring is also critical when discussing the investment, we collectively need to make to connect residents and businesses in the future. Speed needed in future reference. Moore’s law for speed </p><p>As the Journey through the Internet slides highlighted fiber-optic wiring provides a dramatic and generational advancement as compared to copper coaxial cables that replaced the prior copper telephone wiring. To understand how much of the wiring running under the streets of these communities was fiber as compared to copper, Everett, Chelsea, and Revere leveraged their Cable Franchise agreements to obtain line level data that identified the network of fiber and coaxial of the two major residential providers Comcast and RCN. In addition, MAPC also purchased commercial provider data from GeoTel to reference and help fill out the picture of wiring running under the streets of these communities. </p><p>Looking just at Comcast and RCN networks coaxial wiring is the dominant wiring technology in place in the communities today. Copper coaxial wiring lines the telephone poles and it also today plays a critical role at and inside the home/dwelling. The wiring cable companies helped install in homes over past decades and provided them with a competitive market advantage (over telecom) when it was discovered that the same coaxial cable technology could be leveraged for internet services in addition to cable tv service, is also today a limiting factor in providing faster and more advanced services (need referenced / clear examples here like HD video streaming, teleconferencing, gaming etc.). As coaxial technology can be relied on to provide speeds for the services plans available today (Avg plan in area?)in the hundreds of Mbps download. It is a limiting factor in the available download speeds. Symmetrical speeds of 100 over 100 are not easily or efficiently achieved with coaxial cable technology. While lab settings or incremental advancements can help improve the speeds to coaxial cable wiring, it’s physical properties do not compare with the ability and potential fiber-optic cables can provide. </p></div><div class="section-two-col-flex"><div class="section-half"><p>If we look at fiber lines Comcast and RCN leverage today in the communities there is significantly less  wiring than copper coaxial wiring. Using the propriety maps of Comcast and RCN, obtained through the cable franchise agreement, MAPC created this map that shows census blocks in all three communities that have fiber running with in them from these two providers. </p><p>This map highlights that fiber lines are not ubiquitous in our three communities. As fiber comes to replace coaxial cabling throughout our cities and homes significant investment will be needed to accomplish this feat.  </p></div><div class="section-half"><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/fiber-lines-1e3f6e130a3d9a137049fafda6cc9755.png"/><p>Details: A 200ft buffer was applied to the fiber lines. From that a percentage of coverage of  census block track was calculated.</p></div></div><div class="section"><p>Another look at the availability of fiber is to look at the FCC ISP self-reported data mentioned in the access section. This data highlights the census blocks, which at min could be just one building per block, that are connected with fiber. The map below shows for the 4 major residential providers in the communities and served Comcast, RCN, Starry and NetBlazer only Starry and NetBlazer report having any census blocks connected by fiber, and in total only 9 blocks are reported. </p><img src="/digital-equity-report/static/fcc_residential_fiber_providers-8a38a443dd02882639925cb0cf51de1a.png"/><p>While neighboring suburbs have more fiber to the home connection option available. Residents in these communities do not have that option available to them.  Verizon is one ISP with residential fiber options (FIOS) that does not report serving census blocks in Everett, Chelsea, Revere as they do in other parts of the MAPC region.</p><p>While copper lines will cotinine to play a role as we look towards federal and private investment gear towards making infrastructure investments, including ARPA and IIJA, it is important to make investments in the technologies that will be needed to serve us all in 10, 20, 30 years down the line. Just as public investments in roads, sewers, and highways have generational lifespans, we are now at the similar   </p></div><div class="section"><h4>Cable Franchise Agreements</h4><p>As mentioned above fiber mapping is made possible through language in the Cable franchise agreements municipalities have with cable providers that operate service within a city. This is a critical touchpoint between municipal governments and private internet services providers and many of the same cable provider companies are internet service providers. (Call / bill reference to change DTC purview?)   It’s important to note that in addition to broadband internet service, Comcast, RCN, and Verizon often offer other media services such as cable television or phone service. As mentioned in the history section of this report, cable television service that had once been the primary offering has steadily seen residents in these communities “cut the cord” to cable television. Department of Television and Cable subscription numbers for these communities have steadily declined from 10,603 Comcast cable television subscribers in 2011 to 7,000 in 2020. RCN also saw significant loss in subscribes with a 56% drop in subscribes between the start of their cable television services in 2017 and 2020.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="assessment"><div><div class="section"><h2>Community Needs Assessment</h2><p>Expanding on the existing conditions analysis, MAPC worked to further understand the specific experiences of residents in the three communities accessing and using the internet.
