In this report we use the framework of the “three-legged stool” to represent the many facets that make up this complicated, interconnected topic. It’s not a comprehensive analogy but does provide a reminder that solutions or interventions must not only work for resolving isolated challenges, but be part of a larger web actions, rooted in systemic and social justice.

Public utilities like such as water, electricity or public infrastructure like highways have a different ownership and regulation model from internet infrastructure.

"),a.createElement("p",null,"While our three municipalities do manage fiber, conduit and connection center equipment, they do so for an internal public network that connects police, fire, and city staff to the internet and each other. Several municipalities across the commonwealth have extended or built publicly owned networks, under different models, that have extended beyond municipal needs or activities. A small-scale example of this is the extending of “public” networks at town halls or libraries through open public access points. This extension of the network draws on the capacity of the IT for the municipality either internal or contracted.  "),a.createElement("p",null,"Municipalities in some more rural parts of Massachusetts have taken on the role of providing publicly-owned broadband networks and resident access, often by establishing or leveraging the organizational structure and capacity of their municipal power and light plants (LINK TO LIST OF MUNI ACTIVITIES OR ILSR MAP) to become an ISP. Larger scale expansion of internet service, reliant on publicly owned infrastructure, has a number of examples in western MA To date, this model is commonly used often where no private company was willing to make the investment in wired connection of householdsto very low density areas. Municipalities have taken on the role of establishing or leveraging power and light plants (LINK TO LIST OF MUNI ACTIVITIES OR ILSR MAP) to become an ISP. Serving households or businesses with the potential to connect to other municipalities, or research institutions. In many cases the municipality have chosen to become the owner of infrastructure technology (tech referenced in slides above) as well as the provider of service ISP. This requires substantial planning (Link to and check out Cambridge and Boston, Quincy planning) as well as capacity and staffing either at a municipality, power and light utility, or private public partnership. Some government entities have also taken on the role of just owning the infrastructure and not becoming an ISP, but rather creating an open market for ISP to lease from the government their technology/infrastructure/fiber. This model is referred to as Open Access Networks and is common in other parts of the world. More example about this model can be found here: "),a.createElement("p",null,"Case studies of Government run Open Access Networks "),a.createElement("p",null,"Municipal Models Draft Literature Review "),a.createElement("p",null,"The majority of pipes/conduit, fiber and copper cables, poles and connection center equipment that run through Everett, Chelsea, and Revere are owned by private companies.

Additionally, Comcast asserts that they only leverage infrastructure owned and managed by them in their hybrid coaxial / fiber network. (link to slides from Everett town council meeting Jan 21). Other providers we will see later in this report like Crown Castle, First Light serve as owners of infrastructure/fiber who may lease to other companies like RCN or Starry to provide residential service.
