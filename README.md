# Digital Equity Plan: Everett, Chelsea, & Revere

This [site](https://mapc.github.io/digital-equity-report/) is a digital toolkit created to share the digital access and equity plans developed for Everett, Chelsea, and Revere.

## Development

This site was built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and uses `npm` for package management. Install the Gatsby CLI with `npm i gatsby-cli`, then install local dependencies with `npm install`. Run the site in development with `gatsby develop` and clear the cache with `gatsby clean`. Create working branches off of the `develop` branch, then merge commits from `develop` into `main` when ready to deploy to production.

## Deployment

This site is built from the `gh-pages` branch. To deploy changes, push code to the `main` branch, pull down changes, then run `npm run deploy`.
