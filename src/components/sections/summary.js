        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <h4>Now is time to close the Digital Divide</h4>
        <p>Equity is the condition of fair and just inclusion into a society. Equity will exist when those who have been most marginalized have equal access to opportunities, power, participation and resources and all have avenues to safe, healthy, productive, and fulfilling lives. It requires restructuring deeply entrenched systems of privilege and oppression that have led to the uneven distribution of benefits and burdens over multiple generations. Society will be stronger when the promise in all of us is actualized. With inspiration from: Policy Link, King County Office of Equity and Social Justice</p>

        <p>Ben Forman, a Research Director at the Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth (MassINC), published “Gateway Cities at the Center of the digital divide in Massachusetts” in May of 2020. MassINC is a nonprofit think tank and news source in the state. Forman’s article provides an overview and visualization of the Census Bureau data on internet and device access for Gateway Cities in the state. The articles provides maps and key findings from this data that are filtered so that the reader can best understand the digital divide as it pertains to education for students in these cities.</p>
        <p>MassINC’s analysis of the Census data highlights the often underestimated demand for computers provided by this data set that comes from the Census. This is due to the count of households instead of a count of students by the Census. The article provides support for programs within the state that provide computers, internet access, and capacity building in the digital space. Key facts include that nearly 30,000 Gateway City households with school-age children at home do not have a laptop or desktop, more than 23,000 Gateway City households with school-age children do not have internet access, and that while Gateway Cities make up one-quarter of all households in the state, they account for more than 40 percent of households with no computers. This article is best used to support efforts towards sustainable device and internet access in the state, starting with communities of the highest need.</p>
