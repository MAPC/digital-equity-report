The COVID-19 pandemic has upended daily life in Greater Boston and around the world. Thousands of people can’t report to work, and millions are being told to cease nonessential travel. Never before has the internet been so essential for working remotely and staying connected. MAPC’s urban communities have identified access to fast, reliable, and affordable internet was a challenge to residents and businesses.  

Through economic recovery and resilience efforts there is an opportunity to make significant investments to address systemic issues that underpin the “Digital Divide”. Leveraging funds made available through the Economic Development Administration’s Disaster Mitigation and Planning Grant, made available through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, MAPC partnered with municipalities who were facing COVID recovery challenges and both acute and systemic Digital Divide issues.  

To skill up on this area of planning and research MAPC connected and partnered with organizations steeped in this work for decades and internally staffed to be able to partner and provide planning services to this area of focus demanding attention. Guided by newly released open data and inspired by research from other states, MAPC produced the December 2020 “Need for Speed” data visualization that looked at speed test data across the 101 municipalities in MAPC’s urbanized region.  

This work connected us to connect with communities hit hard by the pandemic and with populations most in need of recovery assistance and future resiliency. MAPC partnered with leaders in Everett, Chelsea, & Revere who were working to address digital access, residents had raised in their communities. Residents in these communities were experiencing average internet speeds much lower than the available, advertised interest speeds along with device and literacy challenges related to the internet. The MAPC visualization of speed data depicted these communities with some of the lowest average download speeds of any municipality in the region. To explore the challenges and opportunities further, MAPC and the Cities partnered to develop this plan that is scaled to fit the capacity of municipal staff while leveraging a strong resource network of local, state, and federal resources that cross the public, private, educational, and nonprofit sectors.
